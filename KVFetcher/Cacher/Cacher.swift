/**
KVCacher is used to either retrieve or save objects into it (for example UIImages).
Key -> a hashable 'key' to find the object.
Value -> the object saved into KVCacher's memory.

You can limit the size of cache by changing: 'maxMemory'. KVCacher keeps track of when an key
was added. Using the 'measureSizeClosure' it calculates size of its memory and removes the oldest
entries if it memory reaches 'maxMemory'.

Also you can limit the time that an object can live insde the cache by setting the 'maxAge' proeprty
When set, memory is checked for too old objects and they will be deleted (checked when memory full)
